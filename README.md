# Non-Radiative Energy Transfer

Computes the non radiative energy transfer rate from zero-dimensional materials to 2D materials modeled by Gordon-Gartstein since we are mainly interested in the interaction between 0D Quantum Dots and 2D TMDCs. In the code, interaction can be tuned by strain and layer thickness. However since the NRET rate is mainly dependent on the overlap of absorption and emission spectra, anything that tunes that overlap can be implemented on the code.
